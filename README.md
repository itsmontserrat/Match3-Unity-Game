# Evaluation of the Project's Design and Organization
## Advantages:
1.	Separation of Concerns: The project appears to follow the principle of separation of concerns, with different scripts handling different aspects of the game (e.g., UI, controllers, utilities).
2.	Modularity: The use of separate files for different functionalities (e.g., BoardController, LevelCondition, Utils) suggests a modular design, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
3.	Unity Integration: The project leverages Unity's features effectively, such as using ScriptableObject for configuration (ConfigScrtbObj.cs) and MenuItem for editor tools (MainToolMenu.cs).
4.	Use of Enums and Dictionaries: The use of enums and dictionaries in the Board class for managing item types and counts is a good practice for maintaining clean and efficient code.
## Disadvantages:
1.	Scattered Usings: Each file has its own set of using directives, which can lead to inconsistencies and potential redundancy.

3.	Lack of Comments and Documentation: The provided code snippets lack comments and documentation, which can make it harder for new developers to understand the codebase.
4.	Tight Coupling: Some classes might be tightly coupled, making it harder to test and maintain the code. For example, the Board class directly interacts with GameManager, which could be abstracted for better testability.
5.	Complexity in BoardController: The BoardController class has a lot of responsibilities, including handling user input, managing game state, and controlling the board. This can make the class difficult to maintain and extend.
6.	Magic Numbers: The code contains magic numbers (e.g., 0.2f in ShiftDownItemsCoroutine), which can make the code less readable and harder to maintain.
## Suggestions for Organizing the Project
1.	Directory Structure:
•	Scripts:
•	Board: Contains all board-related scripts (Board.cs, BonusItem.cs, etc.).
•	Controllers: Contains all controller scripts (BoardController.cs, LevelCondition.cs, LevelMoves.cs).
•	UI: Contains all UI-related scripts (UIPanelPause.cs, UIToggleSound.cs, UIMainManager.cs).
•	Utilities: Contains utility scripts (Utils.cs).
•	Editor: Contains editor scripts (MainToolMenu.cs).
•	ScriptableObjects: Contains all ScriptableObject scripts (ConfigScrtbObj.cs).
•	Resources: Contains all resources like prefabs, scriptable objects, etc.
•	Scenes: Contains all scene files.
•	Prefabs: Contains all prefab files.
2.	Code Documentation:
•	Add XML documentation comments to public methods and classes.
•	Add inline comments to explain complex logic.
3.	Refactor Common Logic:
•	Extract common logic into utility methods or base classes to reduce code duplication. For example, the logic for filling the board with items can be refactored into a utility method.
4.	Decouple Classes:
•	Use interfaces or abstract classes to decouple tightly coupled classes. For example, create an interface for GameManager and use dependency injection to inject it into the Board class.
5.	Consistent Naming Conventions:
•	Ensure consistent naming conventions across the project for better readability and maintainability.

7.	Refactor BoardController:
•	Break down the BoardController class into smaller, more focused classes or components. For example, create separate classes for handling user input, managing game state, and controlling the board.
8.	Replace Magic Numbers:
•	Replace magic numbers with named constants or configuration values to improve code readability and maintainability.

> I have finished task 2, 3, 4.
For task 1, I have added a pooling system in spawning objects, changed a function from using List into Dictionary and remove all (or almost) resource loader for better performance
